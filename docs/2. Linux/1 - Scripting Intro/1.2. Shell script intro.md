## Change `$PATH` for a script

```

* Add below into `~/.bashrc` in droplet to define path to the script 
  
```bash
# define my custom scripts
export PATH="/root/scripts:$PATH"
```

* Create `name.sh` file, add below content 

```bash 
#! /bin/bash
echo "what is your name"
read your-name
#2nd read option: 
#remove first 2 lines then: read -p "what is your name " your-name

echo "hello $yourname nice to meet you!"
echo -----------------------*
```

* Give the file an executable permission 

```
chmod +x name.sh
```

* Once added, in terminal enter: `name.sh`, it just works in any directories.
