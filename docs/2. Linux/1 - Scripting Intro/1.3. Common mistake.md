## Common mistakes 

* [ 3 -eq 3 ] - spaces between [ ]
* a="hello there". 
    ```bash
    echo "$a" 
    if [ "$a" == "hello there" ]; then 
        echo "good"
    fi 
        # use "$a" is to distinguish the strings with space
    ```
* Using `$f`.
    ```bash
    for f in *; 
    do 
        if [ -x "$f" ]; then
            echo "the file $f is executable"
        fi
    done
        # check file names, using "$f" is to also pick up file name with space 
    ```

* Recognise `${a}`.
   
    ```bash
    a="hello"
    b="yesterday"
    echo "${a}_today"
        # to recognise ${a} that is part of the string "_today"
    echo "${a}_good_!{b}"
    ```

* Using single quote '' is to preserve the variable as literal variable. Try below command in terminal, no need to create script file.
   
    ```
    a=hello
    echo ' the value is $a '
    echo " the value is $a "
    ```
