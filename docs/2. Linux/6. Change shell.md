## Check which shell 

* Run `echo $SHELL`, to check which shell
* SHELL to be capitalised 

```
Outputs: /bin/zsh 
Or: /bin/bash
```

## Customised prompt

* Add below to: `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
* More `bash prompt` generators, you can search `bash prompt generator`, there are plenty services. 

```
export PROMPT="%F{green} %m @ %~ ðŸ¤£ â–¶ %f"
```

## Change path from bash to zsh 

1. Run `touch .zshrc` to create a `.zshrc` file to the root folder
2. Add path for `.zshrc` 
3. Reload the file, run `source .zshrc` 

* `compaudit`, after running the command, seeing `there are insecure directories: /usr/local/share/zsh`, run below 2 commands: 

```
sudo chown -R root:group /usr/local/share/zsh/
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/local/share/zsh/ 
```

Run `source .zshrc` again. Passes
