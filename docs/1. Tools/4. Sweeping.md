## Apache Bench

### Install Apache Bench 

```
apt-get install apache2-utils
```

### Send multiple request 

```
ab -n 5000 -c 100 https://example.com:443
```

* Command translate: `ab` stands for `ApacheBench`, send 5000 requests over 100 concurrent connection to `example.com` over port 443

```
ab -n 100 -c 10 https://example.com
```

* 100 requests @ 10 connections => 10 x 10 connections = 100 requests

## Siege 

### Install Siege

```
apt-get install siege 
```

### Send multiple request 
```
siege -v -r 2 -c 5 https://example.com/thumb.png 
```

* Translate: `-v` for both logging, run 2 at one time, 5 concurrent connections. Total Request would be: c5 * r2 = 10 requests. This will outputs 10 lines, 5 lines for 1 run

brew install watch
```

### Watch requests 

```
watch -n 2 'curl -sS https://example.com -D- -o/dev/null | sort'
