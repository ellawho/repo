## Local >> Remote

### Initializing `git` environment on the local PC

```
git init
```
To **initialise** the repository in the folder. This will generate `.git` file which is a **hidden file**. 

### Add files

```bash
echo "hello world" > test.txt
    #create the `text.txt` file
git add test.txt
    #confirm to add new file to `.git` 
git commit 
    #a file pops one, take off the # tag from the file name, then save
git push [remote-address]
    #you will see a new file added to your remote repo
```

> * `git add` can also be used for directory: `git add [folder-name]`

### Basic git command
```
git status
```
To **check** the status 

```
git commit test.txt
```
**Commit** the new file ready for push to the origin. 

```
git checkout -b [new-branch-name]
```
`-b` is to **create** a new branch, then you will be switched to the new branch. 

```
git checkout [existing-branch]
```
This is to **switch** between existing branches 

```
git branch
```
To **check** which branch are you on

```
git branch -D [local-branch-name]
```
To **delete** local branch

```
git push origin -d [remote-branch-address]
```
To **delete** branch remotely
> Note: in case the origin is not set, you may need to use the origin remote address.  

```
git fetch origin 
```
To first **fetch** what you have in the remote address
