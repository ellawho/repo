## How to publish jekyll `just-the-docs` theme to Github Pages? 

It took me a while to work out the steps and workaround to publish my repo to GitHub Pages, as it kept failing when deploying. Here I summarise the steps for my own reference.

## Local `just-the-docs` jekyll theme 

Local installation and development, refer to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and [just-the-docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/){:target="_blank"}. 

## Create Repo on GitHub

{: .label .label-green } 
Good to know

**Newly created repo** has 1 branch, here is where you create new branch 

> 1. type branch name
> 2. click create branch

![new-branch](../assets/images/git/branch.png){:width="400px"}

---

**Switch branch:** GitHub Repo >> Settings >> Branches 
> Note: the setting >> branches will only show if you have 2 branches.

## Configuration and Publishing to GitHub Pages

Assuming you have **ruby** installed already. 

1. Go to your project location 
2. `git clone https://github.com/USER/my-repo-name.git`
3. `cd my-repo-name`
4. `gem install bundler`
5. `bundle init` >> Gemfile will be created after this command 
6. `vim Gemfile` 

Upon open, you see only 2 lines in the file. 

```bash
source "https://rubygems.org"
git_source(:github) { |repo_name| "https://github.com/#{repo_name}" }
```

This documentation is to **install** `just-the-docs` theme, so we add below in `Gemfile` 

```bash
source "https://rubygems.org"
git_source(:github) { |repo_name| "https://github.com/#{repo_name}" }
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.1", :platforms => [:mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin]
gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"
gem "just-the-docs"
```

**After `Gemfile`,** then copy the developed local files to Github ready folder. 

```
vim _config.yml
```

**Open** `_config.yml` 

```bash
remote_theme: pmarsceill/just-the-docs@v0.3.3
#theme: just-the-docs

# I've tested using the actual theme, GitHub Pages build keep failing, still don't know why. 
# Use `remote_theme` instead
```

**Also update** below information on `_config.yml` 

```bash
url: "user.github.io"
# OR, if you have custom CNAME already, you can use: url: "example.com"
baseurl: "/my-repo-name"
```

After all done, run 

```
bundle install
```

Before pushing to remote Github, you can check locally too on `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` 

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
>> You can browse site: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`

```
bundle exec jekyll clean 
```
>> to clean cache files, so after checked locally, to purge the local cache.

## Publish the entire project 

1. `git add --all` or `git add .`.
2. Commit the files: `git commit -m "commit jekyll theme"`.
3. Push the files to github repo: `git push`.

## In case of `rejected` due to `fetch first`? 

You may see error message like this: 

```
! [rejected]        gh-pages -> gh-pages (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/ellawho/repo.git'
```

Under the same directory, do: 

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/USER/my-repo-name.git
    #You might see this: error: remote origin already exists.
    #Ignore and run the next command
git pull origin gh-pages 
```

## Single files update and push to Github

If updated one file `_config.yml`, run below commands to push single file

```
git add _config.yml
git commit
git push 
```
