## All About Basic Git
{: .no_toc } 

Git is to **synchronise files** between local machine and remote repository. I was quite confused in the beginning but eventually got the logic after trying again and again. 

1. [Git Local >> Remote](/docs/git/local-to-remote)
2. [Git Remote >> Local](/docs/git/remote-to-local)

[//]: <> {: .no_toc } is to skip this heading in `table of contents` 

[//]: <> [Link button](http://example.com/){: .btn .btn-blue}
