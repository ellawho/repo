* connection 1: client -> server -> returns 1 single html file 
* connection 2: html -> style.css

## Deploy certificate 

{: .label .label-blue }
Step: 1

Create certificate directory and content 

```
mkdir /etc/ssl/[self-certificate]
Then, add the below 2 files in the above directory
1. example.com.crt
2. example.com.key
```

{: .label .label-blue }
Step: 2

Define certificate path

```bash
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/self-certificate/example.com.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/self-certificate/example.com.key;
```

{: .label .label-blue }
OpenSSL

Using OpenSSL for creating self-signed certificate 

```
openssl req -x509 -days 10 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/self.key -out /etc/nginx/ssl/self.crt
```
> * **openssl** request a new certificate signing (req). **Certificate standards:** we request (x509), valid for 10 days (-days 10), leave password for the key file (-nodes), generate new key during the signing off at the same time (-newkey), type of certificate using rsa with length of 2048 bytes (rsa:2048), write out key (-keyout), in the path /etc/nginx/ssl/self.key, writing out a certificate (-out), in directory of /etc/nginx/ssl/ and save the file as self.crt.
> * outputs some questions, follow the questions 
> * once done, the self.crt and self.key will be generated in the directory 

## Enable HTTP2 in Nginx

events {...}

http {
        
        include mine.type; 

    server {

        root /sites/domo; 

        # enable http2 
        listen 443 ssl http2;
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/self-certificate/example.com.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/self-certificate/example.com.key;
    
    }
}
