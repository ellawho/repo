## Repo started since 2021

In the past year, I had to learn so much fundamental knowledge in order to empower myself in the internet property world.  

I learn by doing. The fundamental working logic eventually came to me once I started implementing and applying what I learned. 

As my knowledge base grew so much, so I gather my learning materials in this repository. Hope this is also helpful to others.

## I choose headless CMS `Jekyll` for this Repo

### Wordpress vs Headless CMS 

> Still don't get it. 

While I am still a loyal Wordpress user. I found headless CMS is better for this repo, it's easier for local developing and convenient for how I can organise my files locally.
